# Video analysis

### Prerequisites
- c++
- OpenCV
- TBB

### Color Analysis
To represent most **prominent** colors in a video we use a color spectrum and a graph. 

We chose to analyze colors in **HSL** **color** **space**. Unlike RGB it conveniently gives us hue, saturation and luminance(or lightness) - 3 qualities that are convenient and **human-friendly**. With HSL we could easily dissect the hues of the colors from their properties i.e. light blue, dark blue and blue have the **same hue** but different luminance and saturation, which helps us accomplish our mission, determine the promimence of different colors in a video. 

We have two properties to deal with -- **saturation** and **lightness**. With saturation it is simple, the more saturated the color the more eye-catchy it is. With lumimance it aslo quite easy, the most promiment colors are at the 50%, as with the luminance increase colors get more white, washed-out and with the decrease tehy get darker. These ideas are combined in a [habr post by akurilov](https://habr.com/ru/post/524978/), where he provides the formula for the "**weight**" of the color:
> W (S, L) = S * (0.52 - (0.5 - L)2) / 0.52

### Increase working eficency
To make our computer use all it's resourses we use threads. Because we are doing lots of the same work while analysing each frame it's a good idea to do it in paralel. For that we use oneTBB library. The best solution we fuond is to use 3 types of threads: Dividing, Analysing and Merging. First threads is where we took all nessesary frames from the video and put them into a concurent_queue. Then the next threads analyse frames in this queue pushing results vectors into anuther queue and finaly mergind threads, which are merge all results together. 

### Accuracy of the analysis
Analysing fullscale video frames is time and resource consuming, but also **unnecessary**, therefore we downscale each frame to 256x144 px. However, making a frame by frame analysis is **also uncalled-for**, so we analyze n frames with equal time intervals between them. After a quick analysis of below-mentioned graphs it is clear that the **sweet-spot** between accuracy and efficiency is between 50 and 100 frames. *(btw, the film analyzed is The Joker(2019))*

### Results
As a result we provide a color spectrum, where the graph represents the promimence of the colors, and the higher the hue the more saturated it is.



The Matrix(1999) with its notoriously green color scheme also seeems to be adequately represented by [the trailer's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8e-FF8MsqU) color scheme.

Ridley Scott's The Martian(2015) depicts breathtakingly marvelous scenery of the red planet, and a warm color palette with subtle blueish accents masterfully accompanies the film. (There's also a narrow but promiment green spike on the graph due to [the trailer's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej3ioOneTy8&t=97s) opening screen)
